# Notes

My current goals are the following:

- Simplify the emulator structure
- Improve documentation
- Improve interop capabilities
- Improve performance

Here are some non-goal:

- Be super portable, I'm assuming the host machine is one of macOS, Linux or Windows.
- Keep compatibility with the existing toolchain, I'm doing this to learn more and the best way is to hack through

## Tasks

- Debugger proper breakpoints
- Inline interrupt timers?
- Proper crystal devices?
- Debugger command aliases & help grouping
